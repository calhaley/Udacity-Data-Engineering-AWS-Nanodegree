# Projects
---
<ins>Cassandra ETL</ins>
* In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Cassandra and build an ETL pipeline using Python. We will build a Data Model around our queries that we want to get answers for.

<ins>Web Scrapying using Scrapy, MongoDB ETL</ins>
* In storing semi-structured data, one form to store it in, is in the form of documents. MongoDB makes this possible, with a specific collection containing related documents. Each document contains fields of data which can be queried. 
* In this project, data is scraped from a books listing website using Scrapy. The fields of each book, such as price of a book, ratings, whether it is available is stored in a document in the books collection in MongoDB.

<ins> Data Warehousing with AWS Redshift</ins>
* This project creates a data warehouse, in AWS Redshift. A data warehouse provides a reliable and consistent foundation for users to query and answer some business questions based on requirements.

<ins> Data Lake with Spark & AWS S3 </ins>
* This project creates a data lake, in AWS S3 using Spark. 
* Why create a data lake? A data lake provides a reliable store for large amounts of data, from unstructured to semi-structured and even structured data. In this project, we ingest json files, denormalize them into fact and dimension tables and upload them into a AWS S3 data lake, in the form of parquet files.

<ins> Data Pipelining with Airflow </ins>
* This project schedules data pipelines, to perform ETL from json files in S3 to Redshift using Airflow. 
* Why use Airflow? Airflow allows workflows to be defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative

<ins> Capstone Project </ins>
